# FPGA UART Transceiver w/ BRAM for device verification
# *THIS PROJECT IS IN PROGRESS*
The Verilog code is for the Basys 3 FPGA board with Artix-7 chip. It utilizes the UART protocol to send logic inputs to a device under test. The DUT will send outputs back to the FPGA where the FPGA will verify if the correct outputs have been produced. The goal of the project is the be able to transfer the code from the trainer board onto a more industrial FPGA device with wider pinout.
